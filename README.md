BeePong, or 42 name `ft_transcendence`, is the last core project we did at Hive Helsinki, presenting a modern reinterpretation of the classic Pong game. Leveraging a robust Django-powered backend and a single page application (SPA) vanilla JavaScript frontend, this project introduces a remote multiplayer experience with real-time interactions and AI opponent. 


## Overview
